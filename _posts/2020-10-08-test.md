After a team vote this weekend, we have officially rebranded the Sleuth Capital project as Sleuth AI! We're excited to share this update with our many fans. The change comes as an effort to communicate the shifting focus of the business model, away from an investment fund and towards an AI service provider! Excited to move forward under the new name and continue to build our brand as intelligent, capable entrepreneurs with support from EdVenture and the administration at Edinburgh Innovations! More to come.
