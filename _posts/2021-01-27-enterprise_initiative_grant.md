Edinburgh Innovations organization has awarded an Enterprise Initiative Grant to the Sleuth AI team to fund an investment into our computer infrastructure. The funds from this grant will be applied to support the live operation of our platform. With these funds, we can support our initial user base and provide them the full range of Sleuth AI data science tools. Many thanks to Edinburgh Innovations for their support of this startup!
