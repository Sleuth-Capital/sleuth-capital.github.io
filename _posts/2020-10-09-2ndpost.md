After some heavy debate over the scope of the scraping services that Sleuth AI will provide, tech lead Christoph Minixhofer announced that a slight shift in business model focus will be taking place. Going forward, Sleuth AI plans to serve programmers with tools that help process and execute on data which they will have already scraped themselves. We'll offer a platform to turn their scraped data and related hypotheses into a functional trading strategy with backtested proof that the strategy works, or that it does not, based off of the financial returns data and KPI's. More to come as we continue to develop the concept!
