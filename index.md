        <p>It's not enough to have a brilliant data-driven trading strategy: programmers need to scrape, clean, and format data for use, which takes time. We make it easy to scrape even the messiest unstructured microtext data in our system using our Sleuth Scrape API.</p>

        <p>Build and test trading models around any alternative text data you can scrape with professional-quality tools. You'll see explanations for trade suggestions and performance indicators for every model you build, so you can spend more time exploring ideas.</p>
